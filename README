A simple ember.js app using grunt for the client side build step


To run the ember.js locally

    npm install
    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    grunt local &
    ./bin/server

    visit http://localhost:3000 to see the running app


To run the javascript tests

    npm install
    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    grunt test


To deploy the ember.js application to a production server

    npm install
    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    grunt deploy

    visit your production endpoint -the js file will be renamed on the fly


Known issues: tests will not work with RC6 just yet
